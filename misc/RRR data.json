  "description": "A campaign set in the Bioshock universe! In recent months, reports have surfaced of children - exclusively little girls - being abducted by a sea monster with a single glowing red eye. Has the tainted water of Innsmouth beget a new abominiation? Or has this creature migrated from even greater depths?"
